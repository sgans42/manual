                        <p>Sharing documents with others is an important process of collaboration and expressing ideas and information. Sharing via email is a very quick and effective way to allow access of files and documents to colleagues, clients, employers, professors, etc. To get to sharing information, specifically in the digital age, one must remember to save their files so their work is kept safe and complete. Unlike physical documents, you cannot stow away virtual documents into a physical location. So, you must make sure your file is saved into a virtual location.</p>

                        <p>What is a Word Doc? A Word Doc is a DOC file saved and created through the Office 365 application: Word. The .doc file is a filename extension used for word processing documents. A .docx is a broader file, similar to .doc, that can be opened by Microsoft Word, Apple Pages, OpenOffice, or GoogleDocs. What is email? Email is the distribution of messages from one computer or other electronic device to another via a network. What is sharing? Sharing virtual documents refers to “a digital file or document that can be assessed by specific users for viewing, downloading, or making changes to.” Sharing is different from sending because sending is just to “convey or transfer”, where the sending party no longer has access to the material sent. Why share? Many people share their documents in collaboration efforts with their colleagues, employers, or professors to see edits and changes made to documents while also adding notes and remarks regarding information in the document. Sharing is needed when two or more parties need to see each others’ work in real time.</p>
