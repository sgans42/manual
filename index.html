                        <p>Sending documents with others is an important process of collaboration and transferring ideas and information. Sending via email is a very quick and effective way to allow access of files and documents to colleagues, clients, employers, professors, etc. To get to sending documents via email, saving documents is vital to store and organize information so it does not get lost or erased. Before you can send information you must save it in case troubles arise that could delete the files.                    </div>

                        <p><b>What is a Word Doc?</b>
                        <br>A Word Doc is a DOC file saved and created through the Office 365 application: Word. The .doc file is a filename extension used for word processing documents. A .docx is a broader file, similar to .doc, that can be opened by Microsoft Word, Apple Pages, OpenOffice, or GoogleDocs. What is email? Email is the distribution of messages from one computer or other electronic device to another via a network. What is sharing? Sharing virtual documents refers to “a digital file or document that can be assessed by specific users for viewing, downloading, or making changes to.” Sharing is different from sending because sending is just to “convey or transfer”, where the sending party no longer has access to the material sent. Why share? Many people share their documents in collaboration efforts with their colleagues, employers, or professors to see edits and changes made to documents while also adding notes and remarks regarding information in the document. Sharing is needed when two or more parties need to see each others’ work in real time.</p>

The other option is sharing. Sharing is when a digital file or document can be assessed by specific recipients for viewing, downloading, or making changes to.
